<h3>Exploring Historical Fire Regimes with LANDFIRE data</h3>

**Randy Swaty, Ecologist with The Nature Conservancy's LANDFIRE team**

Curious about the historical fire regimes of our national forests I put together this simple dashboard using [US Forest Service Admin Boundaries](https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php?dsetCategory=boundaries) and LANDFIRE's [Biophysical Settings Data](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/bps).  

Using Parameterized Reports in Quarto/R I generated a custom report for each forest within the lower 48 states. **Click on the forest polygon to get a link to a custom report.**

<h2>LANDFIRE</h2>

[LANDFIRE](https://landfire.gov/) (Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools)  is a shared interagency wildland fire management data program across the United States and Territories. Leadership, management, and oversight are through the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service - Fire and Aviation Management and the U.S. Department of the Interior – Office of Wildland Fire.

LANDFIRE provides more than twenty landscape-scale geospatial products of biological and ecological data, including data such as (900+) vegetation types and (13/40) fire behavior fuel models that support all-lands planning, fire and natural resources management, operations, analyses and assessments.
